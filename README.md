# PortfolioTracker
GUI Python portfolio tracker
the Login File is for the Login Window which kicks off the whole application 
I have connected a mysql databse to the program via the mysql connector module
The portfolio.py code has 3 frames for the same window to add/delete holdings, News and comparisons.
I am left with adding the api, matplot and connecting the webscraper to display the information on the app.
