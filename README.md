# PortfolioTracker
GUI Python portfolio tracker
the Login File is for the Login Window which kicks off the whole application 
I have connected a mysql databse to the program via the mysql connector module
The portfolio.py code has 2 frames for the main window. One to add/delete holdings and view the portfolio and the other for News.
I am left with adding the api, matplot and connecting the webscraper to display the information on the app.
